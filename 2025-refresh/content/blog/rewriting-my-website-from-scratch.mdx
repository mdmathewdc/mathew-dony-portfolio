The previous version of my portfolio website was built in 2022, so it was long overdue for a refresh. I also wanted a proper blog space to share my thoughts and experiences from the software engineering world. I recently got a Cursor license, so this felt like a great project to try it out on.

## The Stack

- **Next.js**: I moved from the old Next.js 12 `pages` router to Next.js 16 with the `app` router. React Server Components (RSC) are the future!
- **CSS**: I used to love `styled-components` since it allowed me to write raw CSS. But with the project entering maintenance mode after the React 19 Context API deprecation, I had to switch to `tailwindcss`. I was skeptical at first because I thought memorizing all the utility classes would be annoying. Turns out I was completely wrong - Tailwind made styling faster, simpler and way more enjoyable. No more coming up with silly tag names like `<StyledButtonWithRadius />` and passing props into it.
- **Blog**: I went with MDX which lets me mix Markdown and JSX. This way I can embed code snippets or interactive components whenever I need to like this:

```java
// Example: Simple user authentication
public class AuthService {
    public boolean authenticate(String username, String password) {
        User user = userRepository.findByUsername(username);
        if (user == null) {
            throw new UserNotFoundException("User not found");
        }
        return passwordEncoder.matches(password, user.getPasswordHash());
    }
}
```

- **Tracking post views**: Under progress.
- **Like counter**: Under progress.

I'm going to keep this first post short and sweet :)

_P.S. There are some Easter eggs that I've hidden throughout the website_
